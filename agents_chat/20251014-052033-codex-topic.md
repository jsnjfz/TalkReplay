## Summary

- Adjusted Codex session title selection to use the user prompt immediately preceding the first assistant reply, aligning topic defaults with transcript expectations.
- Refined the heuristic again to anchor on the very first assistant message (including reasoning/tool preambles) so we always capture the user prompt that triggered the AI.
- Unblocked Husky lint gate by tidying the new schema normaliser/transforms helpers and Tailwind ordering warnings.

## Code Highlights

```ts
// src/lib/providers/codex.ts
const firstAssistantIndex = messages.findIndex(
  (message) => message.role === "assistant",
);
```

- Walk backward from the first assistant message (regardless of kind) to capture the preceding user prompt and prefer it when computing `session.topic`.
- Normalised schema helpers (`src/schema/normaliser.ts`, `src/schema/transforms.ts`) and Tailwind ordering in `src/components/chats/chat-detail.tsx` so lint stays green.
- Logged the heuristic adjustment in `tasks.md` to keep milestone notes in sync.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm test`
  - ✅ Expected: vitest suite passes.
  - ✅ Actual: All 9 files, 16 tests passed.
- `pnpm lint`
  - ✅ Expected: eslint completes with no violations.
  - ✅ Actual: Hook blockers resolved; lint exits 0.
- `pnpm test src/lib/providers/__tests__/codex-topic-debug.test.ts` (temporary local harness)
  - ✅ Expected: targeted harness confirms the rollout log topic resolves to the corrected user prompt.
  - ✅ Actual: Reported topic `"不对，是在第一个ＡＩ　回复之前的用户消息"`.

## Follow-Ups

- None.

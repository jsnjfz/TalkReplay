# Fixtures Refresh

## Summary

- Refreshed Claude and Codex sample logs under `fixtures/` to match schema-driven parsing and cover command execution, file changes, web search, MCP calls, and error cases.
- Updated `tasks.md` Milestone 1.A entry to mark the fixtures refresh as complete.

## Code Highlights

- `fixtures/claude/tool_use_result.jsonl`: added schema-aligned tool use/results with success and failure outcomes including stdout/stderr surfaces.
- `fixtures/claude/project-tool/tool-session.jsonl`: enriched diagnostic sample with `toolUseResult` metadata for normaliser coverage.
- `fixtures/codex/file_change_mcp.jsonl`: now dual-shapes item payloads (top-level + legacy `payload`) and includes reasoning/agent message completions.
- `fixtures/codex/file_change_with_diff.jsonl`, `fixtures/codex/web_search.jsonl`: upgraded to schema-compatible items retaining diff/query data.
- `fixtures/codex/2025/01/01/tool-session.jsonl`: expanded with tool_use/tool_result variants, command execution items, and error scenarios feeding schema mappings.
- `tasks.md`: flagged fixtures refresh milestone as completed with context note.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm test src/lib/providers/claude.snapshot.test.ts src/lib/providers/codex.snapshot.test.ts src/lib/providers/codex.diff-websearch.test.ts src/app/api/__tests__/sessions-api.test.ts -- --runInBand` → fails (`Unknown option --runInBand`); Vitest runs serially by default so flag removed.
- `pnpm test src/lib/providers/claude.snapshot.test.ts src/lib/providers/codex.snapshot.test.ts src/lib/providers/codex.diff-websearch.test.ts src/app/api/__tests__/sessions-api.test.ts` → passes; confirms refreshed fixtures parse across snapshot/API suites.

## Risks & Follow-ups

- Schema and legacy parsers both rely on fixtures; future provider payload changes may require another dual-shape update to keep backward compatibility while the legacy path remains.
- Consider adding coverage for streaming/partial `response_item` updates when they land to exercise incremental normalisation logic.

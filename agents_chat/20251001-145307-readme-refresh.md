## Summary

- Rebranded the project to TalkReplay, framing it as a vibe coding replay tool for Claude and Codex sessions.
- Rewrote the English README with updated positioning, screenshots, and instructions that reflect the new name and Docker image tags.
- Added a Chinese README counterpart so bilingual contributors can follow the same workflow.

## Code Highlights

```markdown
# README.md

- New introduction emphasising vibe coding use cases and dual-pane explorer.
- Interface preview table embeds ./ui1.png and ./u2.png for quick visual context.
- Docker commands now target the talk-replay image and describe provider env defaults.
```

```json
# package.json
{"name": "talk-replay"}
```

```markdown
# README.zh.md

- Provides the same sections（开发、Docker、质量）in Simplified Chinese with links back to README.md.
```

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
  - All commands succeeded after documentation updates.

## Risks / Follow-ups

- Large PNG previews increase repo size; consider generating compressed web versions if download footprint becomes an issue.
- Translate future documentation updates to keep README.md and README.zh.md aligned.

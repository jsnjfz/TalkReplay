## Summary

- Added `docs/schema-contribution.md` detailing schema versioning, contribution workflow, and mandatory tests.
- Linked the new guide from `docs/data-sources.md` and marked the related milestone task as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Code Highlights

```md
# Schema Contribution Workflow

- Every schema lives under `src/schema/providers/<provider>/schemas/` with a stable `$id`.
- Prefer additive changes; bump the `$id` suffix when breaking compatibility.
```

- Review checklist ensures mappings reference documented transforms and tests cover `resolveMappingId`.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`

## Risks / Blockers / Follow-ups

- Future schema work should add fixture references to `docs/schema-contribution.md` once sample catalog expands.
- Consider folding benchmarking guidance into the same document after tooling is selected.

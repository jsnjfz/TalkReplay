## Summary

- Added a production-ready `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` so the app can run in a container with Claude/Codex logs mounted as volumes.
- Documented build/run instructions and environment overrides in `README.md`.

## Code Highlights

- `Dockerfile` – multi-stage build (pnpm install, Next.js build/prune, non-root runtime) exposing `/app/data/{claude,codex}` for transcripts.
- `docker-compose.yml` – maps host log directories via `CLAUDE_LOGS_PATH` / `CODEX_LOGS_PATH` (defaults to bundled fixtures) and forwards `${APP_PORT:-3000}`.
- `README.md` – new Docker usage section with commands for raw `docker` and `docker compose` workflows.

## Self-Tests

- Not run (docs/infrastructure changes only).

## Risks / Follow-ups

- Image still depends on pnpm via corepack; ensure build hosts allow corepack activation.
- Compose defaults point at fixture data—remind operators to override for production log directories.

## Touched Files

- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `README.md`

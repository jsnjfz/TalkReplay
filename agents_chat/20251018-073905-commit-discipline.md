# Commit Discipline Update

## Summary

- Added an explicit rule in `AGENTS.md` stressing immediate, atomic commits after each completed work item to reinforce traceability.
- Reiterated that delayed commits are treated as blockers during reviews.

## Code Highlights

- `AGENTS.md`: new bolded bullet under Development Conventions to mandate prompt commits and flag delays as blockers.

## Self-Tests

- No automated tests required for documentation-only change.
- Manual verification: confirmed `AGENTS.md` renders the new rule under Development Conventions.

## Risks & Follow-ups

- Monitor upcoming collaboration rounds to ensure the reinforced guidance is followed; update onboarding materials if confusion persists.
- Revisit this guideline after the next milestone to confirm commit cadence stays compliant.

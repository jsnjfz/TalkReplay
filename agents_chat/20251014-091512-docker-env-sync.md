## Summary

- Refined Docker multi-stage build so `NODE_ENV` is scoped per stage and left unset in the base image to avoid dev dependency pruning during install.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to expose the app on host port 8000 by default for parity with local pnpm dev scripts.

## Code Highlights

```Dockerfile
FROM base AS deps
ENV NODE_ENV=development
```

- Build stage now sets `NODE_ENV=production` explicitly, and compose maps `${APP_PORT:-8000}:3000` for a clearer override path.

## Self-Tests

- `docker build -t talk-replay:test .` → _skipped_ (Docker daemon unavailable inside CI sandbox).
- `pnpm run lint` → **passed** (executed automatically via Husky pre-commit hook).

## Risks / Blockers / Follow-ups

- Need to add a Docker CI job to exercise multi-stage build pipelines once remote runners are provisioned.
- Confirm Windows documentation reflects the new default `APP_PORT` mapping.

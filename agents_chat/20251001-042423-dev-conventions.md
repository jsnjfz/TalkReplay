# Development Conventions Update

## Summary

- Recorded new working agreements: keep commits small, add an `agents_chat` entry capturing prompts for every commit, and update `tasks.md` alongside each change.
- Documented the conventions in `agents.md` and reflected them in the cross-milestone tasks list per the latest request.

## Code Highlights

- `agents.md:118` introduces a "Development Conventions" section outlining the agreed workflow rules.
- `tasks.md:96` expands cross-milestone duties to demand detailed `agents_chat` records and granular commits with corresponding `tasks.md` updates.

## Self-Tests

- Not run (documentation-only change).

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Ensure future contributors read the new conventions before submitting changes.
- Consider automating a checklist to validate `tasks.md` updates in future tooling.

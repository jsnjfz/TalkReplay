## Summary

- Eliminated duplicate React key warnings when rendering chat messages by scoping keys to the current session and stabilising the clipboard feedback logic.
- Ensured copy state still tracks individual messages even when the upstream transcript lacks unique IDs.

## Code Highlights

- `src/components/chats/chat-detail.tsx` now derives a `messageKey` composed of the session id and message id/index, reuses it for both list keys and copy acknowledgements.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm format`

## Risks / Follow-ups

- If transcripts contain extremely long ids the composed key grows; consider hashing in the future if performance becomes a concern.

## Summary

- Ensured Codex session topics default to the last preceding user prompt by adding coverage in `parseCodexSessionFromString` tests.
- Dropped experimental Vitest benchmark harness to keep the workflow lightweight and avoid long-running `pnpm bench` jobs.

## Code Highlights

```ts
// src/lib/providers/codex.test.ts
const CODEX_TOPIC_SAMPLE = `{"type":"response_item",...}`;
...
expect(session?.topic).toBe("Generate release notes for the latest build.");
```

- Added a fixture-style sample that catches regressions in topic derivation when reasoning entries precede the assistant reply.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm test src/lib/providers/codex.test.ts`
- `pnpm lint`

## Risks / Blockers / Follow-ups

- Performance benchmarking remains TODO; consider capturing metrics via standalone Node scripts or profiling in CI when requirements solidify.
- Keep an eye on large Codex logs to confirm the topic heuristic still performs when conversations include system/tool messages before the first assistant reply.

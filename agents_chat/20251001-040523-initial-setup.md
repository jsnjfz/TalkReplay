# Initial Project Scaffold

## Summary

- Established the React + TypeScript + Vite scaffold for the Claude/Codex chat viewer.
- Added Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui-inspired primitives, and theme support with sample chat data.
- Configured linting, formatting, testing, and a Husky pre-commit hook enforcing `agents_chat` records.

## Code Highlights

- `package.json:1` defined project metadata, scripts (including `pnpm test` using `vitest run`), and dependency stack with Husky + Radix UI.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml:1` locked dependency versions for reproducible installs.
- `vite.config.ts:1` configured React SWC, the `@` alias, and Vitest environment/coverage settings.
- `.eslintrc.cjs:1` introduced TypeScript-aware ESLint rules, Tailwind checks, and import ordering.
- `.gitignore:1` expanded ignores for build artefacts (e.g., `*.tsbuildinfo`, Tailwind/Vite JS outputs, `.pnpm-store`).
- `.husky/pre-commit:1` enforces `agents_chat` naming/content, runs lint/test/format checks, and now omits deprecated Husky bootstrap lines.
- `tailwind.config.ts:1` declared theme tokens, animations, and plugin registration for Tailwind CSS.
- `postcss.config.cjs:1` configured PostCSS with Tailwind + Autoprefixer.
- `tsconfig.json:1` and `tsconfig.node.json:1` set strict TypeScript compilation with path alias `@/*`.
- `src/index.css:1` established CSS variables, Tailwind layers, and dark-mode tokens.
- `src/App.tsx:1` composed the layout with sidebar, chat list/detail, and sample session seeding.
- `src/main.tsx:1` bootstrapped React with React Query and ThemeProvider wrappers.
- `src/App.test.tsx:1` provided a smoke test ensuring the app renders within required providers.
- `src/data/sampleSessions.ts:1` supplied representative Claude/Codex transcripts for initial rendering.
- `src/store/chat-store.ts:1` created a persisted Zustand store with filtering helpers and selectors.
- `src/lib/parsers.ts:1` normalised JSON/plain-text transcripts and inferred timestamps/roles.
- `src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx:1` implemented the primary frame with responsive regions.
- `src/components/sidebar/chat-sidebar.tsx:1` delivered filters and search control UI.
- `src/components/chats/chat-list.tsx:1` rendered filtered session previews inside a scroll area.
- `src/components/chats/chat-detail.tsx:1` displayed active conversation content with import/export controls.
- `src/components/theme/theme-provider.tsx:1` and `src/components/theme/theme-toggle.tsx:1` handled persisted theme switching.
- `src/components/ui/button.tsx:1` and `src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx:1` provided reusable shadcn-style primitives.
- `README.md:1` documented setup scripts, structure, and the `agents_chat` policy.
- `agents.md:1` retained the full English specification; `CLAUDE.md:1`, `GEMINI.md:1`, `.github/instructions/agents.instructions.md:1` mirror the spec for reference.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`

Both commands exited with status 0.

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Need to add Docker configuration, CI workflows, and platform packaging in future iterations.
- Expand automated tests to cover parser edge cases, store interactions, and UI state transitions.
- Implement real chat log ingestion (file system/Electron or backend) beyond sample data.
- Storybook, statistics views, and export functionality remain planned enhancements.

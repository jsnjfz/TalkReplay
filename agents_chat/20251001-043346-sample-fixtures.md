# Sample Fixture Enhancements

## Summary

- Enriched the demo conversation data with additional metadata, tool calls, and missing-metadata scenarios to better exercise upcoming providers.
- Marked the related Milestone 1 task as complete.

## Code Highlights

- `src/data/sampleSessions.ts:1` now includes attachments, token usage, tool responses, and an extra Gemini session lacking metadata for edge-case handling.
- `tasks.md:14` reflects completion of the sample fixture expansion task.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Ensure future parsing logic recognises tool messages and missing metadata; adapters should treat these samples as regression fixtures.

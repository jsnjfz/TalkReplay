## Summary

Refine README screenshots: correct captions and swap images so that Home, Provider Setup, and Chat Detail are properly labeled.

## Code Highlights

- Rename files:
  - `docs/assets/project-filter.png` → `docs/assets/chat-detail.png`
  - `docs/assets/chat-detail.png` → `docs/assets/provider-setup.png`
- Update README EN/ZN to match the new labels and order.

## Self-Tests

  - Second: Provider setup dialog
  - Third: Chat detail page (inline images, actions toolbar)

## Touched Files

- README.md
- README.zh.md

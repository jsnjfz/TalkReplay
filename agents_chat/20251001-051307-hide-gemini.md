# Hide Gemini Provider UI

## Summary

- Limited the supported provider list to Claude and Codex, deferring Gemini until its adapter exists.
- Filtered browser fallback data so sample sessions only include Claude/Codex conversations.

## Code Highlights

- `src/types/chat.ts:1` now declares `SUPPORTED_SOURCES` as Claude/Codex only.
- `src/lib/session-loader.ts:1` filters the sample fallback to supported providers while keeping adapter-based imports intact.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Reintroduce Gemini in the UI once its log format and adapter are ready.

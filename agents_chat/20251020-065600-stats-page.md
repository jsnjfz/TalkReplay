## Summary

Implemented `/stats` page using existing `POST /api/projects` API to list project-level counts and allow quick filtering of the main chat list by project. The page supports search, totals, refresh, and a back-to-chats link.

## Code Highlights

```tsx
// src/app/stats/page.tsx
// - React Query fetches LoadProjectsResult via POST /api/projects
// - Search input filters projects client-side
// - Clicking View sets ChatStore project and navigates to /
// - Basic loading/error/empty states with Tailwind styling
```

```json
// i18n strings
// src/locales/en/common.json -> added "stats" namespace keys
// src/locales/zh-CN/common.json -> added matching keys
```

## Self-Tests

Commands:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test:ci
pnpm dev -- --port 3002
```

Manual checks:

- Navigate to `/stats`: shows totals and project cards.
- Type in search: list filters by project name.
- Click "View" on a project: returns to `/` and only that projectâ€™s conversations are shown (project filter applied).
- Click Refresh: re-requests the stats from `/api/projects`.

Expected vs Actual:

- Expected: Correct counts and smooth navigation. Actual: Matches expectations with sample data.

## Risks, Blockers, Follow-ups

- No header/nav entry to `/stats` yet; add navigation later in AppShell.
- Large project lists may benefit from virtualization; track under tasks.md (already planned).
- Consider moving fetcher to a small client util if reused elsewhere.
- Add component tests once the page stabilizes; current global fetch stub in test setup returns session shape and would need per-test override for projects.

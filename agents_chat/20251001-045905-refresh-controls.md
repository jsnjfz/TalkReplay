# Manual Refresh Controls

## Summary

- Added a stubbed session loader and refresh wiring so users can manually rescan provider directories.
- Header and empty states now expose refresh actions with loading indicators.

## Code Highlights

- `src/lib/session-loader.ts:1` centralises the (currently stubbed) loader that will import sessions from configured paths.
- `src/App.tsx:1` orchestrates refresh state, triggers loads on start, and threads controls to child components.
- `src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx:1` includes a refresh button reflecting progress.
- `src/components/chats/chat-list.tsx:1` surfaces refresh/configure buttons when no sessions are available.
- `tasks.md:20` marks the manual refresh/import control task complete.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Session loader currently returns demo data; future work must integrate real filesystem ingestion and error handling.
- Consider exposing refresh feedback (toasts/logging) when actual imports run.

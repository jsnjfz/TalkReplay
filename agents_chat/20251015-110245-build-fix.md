## Summary

- Fixed TypeScript build failure by converting schema-ready Codex log entries into plain records before passing them to Ajv.

## Code Highlights

```ts
// src/lib/providers/codex.ts
const plainEntry: Record<string, unknown> = { ...entry };
return { payloads: [plainEntry] };
```

- Keeps schema mode compatible with `normalise` expectations without mutating the original log object.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm run build`

## Risks / Blockers / Follow-ups

- None â€” change is limited to schema-mode guard path.

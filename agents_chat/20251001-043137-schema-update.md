# Transcript Schema Update

## Summary

- Extended the shared chat types to include Gemini, richer session metadata, and message-level details.
- Updated the store and sidebar to rely on a single `SUPPORTED_SOURCES` list so Gemini is treated as a first-class provider.
- Expanded the sample sessions to include Gemini data exercising the new metadata fields.

## Code Highlights

- `src/types/chat.ts:1` now defines `SUPPORTED_SOURCES`, enriched message/session metadata interfaces, and includes `gemini` in `AgentSource`.
- `src/store/chat-store.ts:1` consumes `SUPPORTED_SOURCES` for default filters, ensuring the new provider is visible by default.
- `src/components/sidebar/chat-sidebar.tsx:1` maps sources dynamically and labels Gemini.
- `src/data/sampleSessions.ts:1` adds a Gemini example with provider details, tokens, and attachments, aligning with the new schema.
- `tasks.md:13` marks the schema task complete with a reference to the updated types.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Downstream parsers and UI components must populate the richer metadata as real data sources are integrated.
- Consider surface-level UI refinements (badges, metadata panels) to present the new fields to users.

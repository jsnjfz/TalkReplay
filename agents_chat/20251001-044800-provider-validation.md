# Provider Path Validation Enhancements

## Summary

- Added per-provider validation to the setup dialog, warning about obviously invalid paths and preventing accidental saves.
- Improved the empty conversation state with localisation, prompting users to configure providers when no data is available.

## Code Highlights

- `src/components/preferences/provider-setup-dialog.tsx:8` tracks field errors and enforces simple path validation before saving.
- `src/components/chats/chat-list.tsx:1` now renders a translated empty state with a configure button.
- `src/locales/*/common.json:1` includes new strings for validation feedback and the empty state.
- `tasks.md:19` marks the validation/error messaging task complete.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Future integration with the File System Access API should replace simple string validation with real directory checks.
- Consider surfacing inline success indicators when directories are verified.

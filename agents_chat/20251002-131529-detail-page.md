## Summary

Separate conversation detail into a dedicated page for better readability and sharing. Added a new route at `/chats/[id]` that renders the full chat detail, updated the chat list to navigate to that page, and simplified the main view to list-only with guidance text.

## Code Highlights

```tsx
// src/app/chats/[id]/page.tsx
"use client";
// Loads detail by id from route params and renders <ChatDetail /> full-page
```

```tsx
// src/components/chats/chat-list.tsx
// On click, navigate to dedicated detail page
router.push(`/chats/${session.id}`);
```

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
// Remove inline <ChatDetail />; show guidance for new navigation
```

## Self-Tests

- Navigation: Click a chat in the list â†’ URL becomes `/chats/<id>` and a full-page detail view appears.
- Shareability: Copy the URL and open in a new tab/window; the same detail view loads.
- No regressions: App header renders and session list interactions (refresh, filters) still work.

Manual commands:

- `pnpm dev` then visit `/` and `/chats/<id>`
- `pnpm test` (should pass existing tests)

## Risks, Blockers, Follow-ups

- Risk: Directly hitting `/chats/<id>` relies on configured provider paths; when missing, API falls back to sample sessions or errors visibly.
- Follow-up: Add a "Copy link" action near export controls, and deep-link breadcrumbs from detail back to filtered list contexts.
